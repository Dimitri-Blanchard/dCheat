A console-based memory scanner for Windows that allows you to search, filter, and modify integer values in another process memory

This tool works similarly to Cheat Engine basic scan/filter features but is implemented in C++ with asynchronous scanning

## ‚ú® Features
- **Attach to a process** by name or PID
- **First Scan**: Search for all memory addresses containing a given integer value
- **Next Scan**: Filter results by a new integer value (progressive narrowing)
- **Edit Values**: Change an integer value at a specific memory address
- **Save & Load**: Store scan results to a file and reload them later
- **Print Results**: Display all currently found addresses and values
- **Asynchronous Scanning**: Uses multiple threads for faster memory searching

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements
- Windows (tested on Windows 11)
- MSVC / MinGW (C++17 or higher)
- Administrator privileges

## üöÄ Build Instructions
1. Open a terminal in the project folder

   4: Save
   5: Load
   6: Print Results
   0: Exit
   ```

### Example Workflow
- Attach to `cheatMe.exe`
- Select `1: First Scan` ‚Üí search for `100`
- Change the value inside cheatMe.exe, then select `2: Next Scan` ‚Üí search for new value
- Repeat until only 1-3 address remains
- Select `3: Edit Value` to change the value of one of these addresses
